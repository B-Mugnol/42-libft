# 42-libft

#### This project has 2 branches: one accomplishing the general and basic original purpose of the project (libft-version-15) and another one with lots of modifications so I could use this library in my future projects (master), so be sure to switch to the branch that most suits your need.

If you google 'libft 42' you'll find very good descriptions as to what this project is and where it comes from, but I'll summarize:

### Why?
To recreate some functions found in certain C libraries, in some cases creating your own version of those functions (given some specifications).


### How?
By exhaustively checking the functions' documentation, understanding its parameters and return values to recreate the described behavior (and adding 'ft_' to the functions' name).


### What?
...the duck is that, commits directly on master??
Yup, and that was on purpose. I had to get familiarized with a lot of new tools and concepts while also testing those newly acquired knowledge, so I just couldn't bother to make my commit history look good.
